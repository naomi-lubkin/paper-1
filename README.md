# Assignment Instructions:

## Description:

Your team is responsible for taking notes and generating a summary of the instructor-led discussion. The topic of this section is purpsefully vague as we will try and find an aspect of each paper to discuss that does not fall into the purview of your assignment. A good summary will include:

(1) The questions posed by the instructors

(2) How/did the question posed change how the class viewed the paper

(3) What does connections can be made between the questions and the concrete components of the paper (i.e. the authorsâ€™ hypotheses, methods, discussion points etc)?

(4) How your process of thinking about epistomology has changed, and if applicable, how your approach to interpreting scientific literature could improve

(5) What you think this paper contributes to your overall understanding of how science happens and how it is subsequently disseminated?

## Submission Guidelines:

In this repository, use the `paper-discussions-template.Rmd` file to generate your summary (1 page max) as an RMarkdown file, titled `[Author(s)]-[Year]-summary.Rmd` and then knit the RMarkdown file to a `.pdf` file. The template is given for ease of reproducing the correct RMarkdown formatting. That `.pdf` file will be what's graded. For example, if generating a summary for the example Favaro et al. (2014) paper, the file would simply be `favaro-etal-2014-summary.Rmd`. 

**Note:** This is a group assignment, but you will all need to submit your assignment (i.e. commit to this repository with your `.pdf` of the summary that you all wrote), but they will all be identical. That is, you all collaborate to write *one* summary, but each of you must submit the identical files.
